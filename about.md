Hi, I am Yew Jie.

Born and raised in Penang, did my Computer Science Degree in Sabah and currently chasing after my life goals in Kuala Lumpur. And yup you are right, I just enjoy being into different places!

I aspire to be the best Data Scientist that I can ever become, and my background up to date has been always centered around preparing myself to be one. Each day I take one small step in improving myself, from learning the nut-and-bots of a machine learning algorithm, big-data concepts, documenting the knowledge I learnt, to building this website and maintaining it and the list goes on and on. It was never mundane to me as I enjoy doing all of these and it has already been part of my _daily ritual_. After all, being a Data Scientist in not a destination, but a journey.

As a Data Production Specialist at [LocalGravity](https://www.localgravity.com/), allow me to introduce you to my favorite bar..._*SPACEBAR*_ - which I heavily depend on daily. My day to day duty include. You can also frequently catch me hanging out at StackOverflow and GitHub during office hours!

Now you are probably starting to ask me to get a life...

Whenever I am not within the _*SPACEBAR*_, I enjoy getting sweaty, and I can be pretty serious with my workouts though. Sometimes, I do some casual reading on the subject of Self-development, Investments, and **COOKBOOK!** (Gordon Ramsey is my personal favorite, Jamie Oliver comes next!). And one more thing, I always appreciate it whenever there is a Saturday night football game!

Thanks for dropping by and this is pretty much about me for the time being, you can always find me on LinkedIn or drop me an email!
