Hi, I am Yew Jie.

Born and raised in Penang, did my Computer Science Degree in Sabah and currently chasing after my life goals in Kuala Lumpur. And yup you are right, I just enjoy being into different places!

I aspire to be the best Data Scientist that I can ever become, and my background up to date has been always centered around preparing myself to be one. Each day I take one small step in improving myself, *what do you do?* after-all being a Data Scientist in not a destination, but a journey.

As a Data Production Specialist at LocalGravity, allow me to introduce you to my favorite bar..._*SPACEBAR*_ - which I heavily depend on daily. My day to day duty include. You can also frequently catch me hanging out at StackOverflow and GitHub during office hours!

Now you are probably starting to ask me to get a life...

Whenever I am not with in _*SPACEBAR*_, I enjoy getting sweaty, and I can be pretty serious with my workouts though. Sometimes, I do some casual reading on the subject of Self-development, Investments, and Money Management. And one more thing, I always appreciate it whenever there is a Saturday night football game!
