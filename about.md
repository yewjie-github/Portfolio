Hi, I am Yew Jie.

Born and raised in Penang, did my Computer Science Degree in Sabah and currently chasing after my life goals in Kuala Lumpur. And yup you are right, I just enjoy being into different places!

I aspire to be the best Data Scientist I can ever become, and my background up to date has been always centered around preparing myself to be one. Each day after work, I take one small step in improving myself, from learning the nuts-and-bolts of a machine learning algorithm, big-data concepts, documenting the knowledge I learnt, to building this website and maintaining it and the list goes on and on. It was never mundane to me as I enjoy doing all of these and it has already been part of my _daily ritual_. After all, being a Data Scientist is not a destination, but a journey. Like what Jack Ma said, _after work, is what determines your future._

> After work, is what determines your future. - Jack Ma

As an Insights Analyst, I had the honor and privilege to work with reputable clients across the region ranging from the oil and gas, consumer goods and retail industry. 

With ever-changing customer needs, managing customer loyalty had been more challenging and there is definitely no one-size-fits-all solution. By leveraging my expertise in advanced analytics involving data analysis, data modeling, data visualization and storytelling, it allowed me to provide honest insights and feasible recommendations which clients can gradually act upon to improve their product and services. Also had the opportunity to work closely with clients through frequent presentation sessions, where I learn first-hand what clients really need and how to provide answers with the appropriate data.

Previously as a Data Production Specialist at [LocalGravity](https://www.localgravity.com/), allow me to introduce you to my favorite bar..._*SPACEBAR*_ - which I heavily depend on daily. My day to day duty include scrapping **_lots and lots_** of retailer's store locations for countries across South East Asia (SEA), **_lots and lots_** of VLOOKUP, Pivot Table and Regular Expression to manipulate data, **_lots and lots_** of geocoding and address segmentation using R! All these work gave me a good understanding of the retail landscape in SEA. You can also frequently catch me hanging out at StackOverflow and GitHub throughout the day and I seriously cannot imagine a world without these sites!

_To make things less boring..._

Whenever I am not within the _*SPACEBAR*_, I enjoy getting sweaty, and I can be pretty _serious_ with my workouts though! I always enjoy challenging my limits and raising my standards, the proudest challenge up to date was successfully reaching the highest submit in South East Asia - Mount. Kinabalu, and completing my first ever full marathon one day after descending from Mount. Kinabalu. Sometimes, I do some casual reading on the subject of Self-development, Investments, and **COOKBOOK!** (Gordon Ramsey is my personal favorite, Jamie Oliver comes next!). And one more thing, I always appreciate it whenever there is a Saturday night football game!

Thanks for dropping by and this is pretty much about me for the time being, you can always find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yewjie) or drop me an <a href="mailto:yewjie.loo@gmail.com">email</a>.
